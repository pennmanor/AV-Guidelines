\textbf{Using a Personally-Owned Laptop with District Wireless Network}

The wireless network ``Guest'' is available for guest access throughout all district buildings.
After connecting, your browser will be directed to a network registration page.
Following acceptance of the Usage Policy, your device will have access to the Internet.

\emph{Important Note:} Penn Manor's Internet connection is filtered. The guest wireless network restricts access to YouTube, Vimeo and other online video streaming services.

\textbf{Audio Visual Connections}

The majority of Penn Manor School District buildings support VGA display connections.
However, the following buildings support HDMI display \textsc{only}:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Manor Middle School
        \item Hambright Elementary School
        \item Central Manor Elementary School
\end{itemize}
Guests intending to present in any of the above buildings must have a device with HDMI output or a compatible HDMI conversion device.
If no such device is available, please contact Information Technology at support@pennmanor.net with a request to obtain a temporary laptop a minimum of five business days prior to the event.
